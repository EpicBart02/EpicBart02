## Some notable projects i've worked on as a *Fullstack Developer*!

### TRAI (Trash Recycling AI) ![Nuxt](https://img.shields.io/badge/Nuxt3-00C58E?style=for-the-badge&logo=nuxtdotjs&logoColor=white) ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-3178C6?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white) ![OpenAI](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenAI-10A37F?style=for-the-badge&logo=openai&logoColor=white)
Due to the high costs of incorrect waste separation worldwide, TRAI was developed as a solution. This AI-powered trash recycling aid encourages proper waste separation. The first launch will take place at Linnaeus University!

Awaits is an AI-driven, web-based tutoring system designed to promote transparency and integrate AI into academic writing. It enhances students writing skills by offering various improvement suggestions, helping them refine their work without directly providing solutions.

### Hackathon: Baltic Perspectives ![Nuxt](https://img.shields.io/badge/Nuxt3-00C58E?style=for-the-badge&logo=nuxtdotjs&logoColor=white) ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-306998?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=FFD43B) ![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-2496ED?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white)
In the summer of 2024, I joined a hackathon to bridge Baltic Sea borders with AI. We created a WhatsApp-like website where AI connects people by understanding current and past events and communicating across languages. This project celebrates unity and innovation in the Baltic region.

## Stay Tuned! I have interesting projects on the way

### Personal Portfolio ![Nuxt](https://img.shields.io/badge/Nuxt3-00C58E?style=for-the-badge&logo=nuxtdotjs&logoColor=white) ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-3178C6?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white) ![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-2496ED?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white)
My next personal project will be a custom-built website portfolio that's all about showcasing my artistic and nerdy side. Expect a mix of crazy, cool, and professional elements, creating a site that's as fun as it is polished. Stay tuned for a unique, eye-popping experience!

### The Archive ![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-00599C?style=for-the-badge&logo=cplusplus&logoColor=white) ![Unreal](https://img.shields.io/badge/Unreal_Engine-0E1128?style=for-the-badge&logo=unrealengine&logoColor=white)
A personal project ive been planning for a long time is a game, called the Archive! It is a psychological horror game with visuals inspired by classic horror games like Silent Hill. Players explore diverse worlds by switching between VHS tapes, uncovering hidden truths and solving puzzles within the memories they contain. This game combines elements of horror, adventure, and puzzle-solving to reveal the haunting connections between memory and reality.
